## ***Our Mission***

**Empowering engineers with a complete picture of their coding journey, bridging the gap between competitive programming and software development.**

Credence is designed to be the **single source of truth** for engineers looking to track their **DSA progress, development contributions, and overall technical growth**. By integrating data from **multiple coding platforms and GitHub**, it provides actionable insights that help users become better programmers and software engineers.

## ***Why Credence?***

Today‚Äôs engineers often engage in **competitive programming** to sharpen problem-solving skills while simultaneously building **real-world projects** to enhance their technical expertise. However, these two aspects of growth remain **fragmented across platforms**, making it difficult to get a **unified view of progress**.

Credence solves this by:

- Aggregating **DSA and development** contributions in one place.
- Providing **actionable insights** to help users improve.
- **Gamifying** progress through scores and badges.
- Offering **team-matching** for hackathons and collaborations.

### ***Why is the Problem Important?***

In today's fast-paced tech industry, engineers are expected to excel in **both problem-solving (DSA)** and **software development** to secure top positions in companies, contribute to open-source projects, and succeed in hackathons. However, tracking and improving across multiple platforms is **fragmented** and **inefficient**.

Existing tools focus on either **competitive programming (CP)** or **development** but fail to offer a **holistic** perspective. As a result:

1. **Competitive programmers** struggle to track **real-world impact** beyond contests.
2. **Developers** lack structured insights into their **coding practices and growth trajectory**.
3. **Hackathon participants** face difficulty in finding **team members with complementary skills**.
4. **Recruiters** lack a single, **data-backed** profile to assess engineering talent effectively.

Credence solves this by providing a **centralized platform** that offers actionable insights, gamifies progress, and integrates **CP and Dev growth** into a **single profile**‚Äîhelping users make **smarter career and learning decisions**.

## ***Target Audience***

Credence is built for:

1. **Competitive Programmers** ‚Äì Track progress across platforms and identify weak areas.
2. **Developers & ML Enthusiasts** ‚Äì Get insights on GitHub activity, code quality, and project impact.
3. **Hackathon Participants** ‚Äì Find the best teammates based on skills, tech stack, and problem statements.
4. **Recruiters & Hiring Managers** ‚Äì Assess candidates' DSA and Dev skills from a single profile.
5. **Aspiring Engineers** ‚Äì Set goals, track progress, and grow in both problem-solving and development.

## ***Projected Growth & Market Potential***

| **Time Frame** | **Competitive Programmers (CP)** | **Developers (Dev/ML)** | **Hackathon Participants** | **Recruiters & Hiring Managers** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Current Market (2025)** | Approximately 1.5 million active users on LeetCode; other platforms' data not specified | Over 100 million GitHub users globally | Data not readily available | Growing demand for data-backed hiring |
| **1 Year (2026)** | Expected growth due to increasing CP adoption for FAANG preparation | Rising focus on GitHub portfolios; significant growth in regions like India ÓàÄciteÓàÇturn0search1ÓàÅ | Anticipated increase in hackathon participation | AI-driven hiring gaining traction |
| **5 Years (2030)** | CP platforms becoming mainstream assessment tools | Developers increasingly relying on open-source and personal projects | Hackathons becoming key hiring pipelines | Data-driven hiring becoming standard |
| **10 Years (2035)** | Integration of CP and development skills in hiring processes | GitHub profiles potentially replacing traditional resumes | Hackathons evolving into corporate hiring platforms | Automated skill assessment becoming the norm |

**Notes:**

- **Competitive Programmers (CP):** The figure of approximately 1.5 million active users on LeetCode is based on available discussions. Data for other platforms like Codeforces and CodeChef is not specified in the provided sources.
- **Developers (Dev/ML):** GitHub reported having over 100 million users globally as of 2022.
- **Hackathon Participants:** Specific global data on hackathon participants is not readily available in the provided sources.
- **Recruiters & Hiring Managers:** There is a growing emphasis on data-backed and AI-driven hiring practices, though specific figures are not provided.

These projections are based on current trends and available data. For more precise figures, especially regarding hackathon participation and recruiter practices, further research with access to comprehensive datasets would be necessary.

### ***Why Now?***

- **Rising demand for holistic skill assessment** ‚Äì Companies are increasingly looking for a **combination of CP & Dev skills** rather than just one.
- **Lack of a single source of truth** ‚Äì Developers still manually track progress across different sites.
- **Market growth in CP & Dev platforms** ‚Äì More users are joining LeetCode, GitHub, and hackathons each year.
- **Shift towards skills-based hiring** ‚Äì GitHub portfolios and coding assessments are **replacing traditional resumes**.

Credence is **positioned at the right moment** to capitalize on these trends and become **the go-to platform for engineers** aiming to **track, improve, and showcase** their technical skills efficiently. üöÄ
